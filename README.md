## About the Video Course
Magento 2 is not just the next version of Magento 1, it is a completely new framework. It introduces a bunch of new libraries and approaches, with more opportunities to implement functionality better. In order to improve modularity, flexibility, and extensibility Magento 2 had to become a bit more complicated than Magento 1. That's why, unfortunately, some of the new approaches in Magento 2 are just not explicit enough. This course explains how the most important parts of the framework are implemented, how they work, and how they can be used. It explores module and theme implementation, demonstrating Magento 2 development patterns and approaches. Finally, the course is not just about functionality implementation, it shares the best practices for managing Magento 2 applications as a whole, covering automated testing, deployment, monitoring, optimization, and migration. The course is intended to cover the most valuable information you need to know as a Magento 2 developer.
